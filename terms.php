		<li>
			We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the <?php echo $website["instance_name"]; ?> service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours. You can remove your profile at any time by deleting your account. This will also remove any private images you have stored in the system. However, by setting your uploaded images as "public", you agree to allow other <?php echo $website["instance_name"]; ?> users to view and share  your images and you therefore agree to allow us to display and store them.
			<ul>
				<li> <strong><em>Important Note:</em></strong> Once a photo is marked public, it cannot be made private again. It may not be deleted when you &quot;remove it from your shoebox&quot;. It will remain on our servers and available to others in the system until 24 hours has passed since any reference to it was stored in any user's shoebox.

Accordingly, we offer the ability to mark your content as belonging to the public domain or as licensed under a <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org" target="_blank">Creative Commons license</a>.
